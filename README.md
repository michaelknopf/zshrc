# zshrc

A well-organized Zsh configuration. The main `~/.zshrc` is intended to be a symlink to `zshrc.sh` in this repository. Configuration that would normally live in `.zshrc` is split so it’s easier to manage and track in Git.

> Note: `oh_my_zsh.sh` in this repo is essentially the `.zshrc` file generated by Oh My Zsh, kept here so it can be version‑controlled and sourced from `zshrc.sh`.

## Layout

```
├── zshrc.sh       Entrypoint (~/.zshrc symlink) → finds repo root, sources modules
├── zshenv.sh      Minimal env vars (~/.zshenv symlink)
├── zshrc.d/       Subfiles sourced by zshrc.sh in order
│   ├── path.sh        Initialize PATH first
│   ├── oh_my_zsh.sh   Load Oh My Zsh (theme, plugins, etc.)
│   └── git.sh         Git aliases (optional)
│   └── ...
└── scripts/       Helper scripts
└── setup.sh       Creates symlinks for ~/.zshrc and ~/.zshenv
```

## Setup

### Quick start (recommended)

Run the setup script to create symlinks for your Zsh config files:

```sh
./scripts/setup.sh
```

This links the following to the files in this repository:
- ~/.zshrc  -> zshrc.sh
- ~/.zshenv -> zshenv.sh

**Requirements:**
- zsh (default on modern macOS; available on most Linux distros)
- Oh My Zsh installed at `~/.oh-my-zsh` (adjustable via the `ZSH` env var in `zshrc.sh` if needed)

`zshrc.sh` now detects the repository directory dynamically; no manual `ZSHRC_ROOT` edits are required. If your Oh My Zsh installation is not at `~/.oh-my-zsh`, set `ZSH` before sourcing or edit it in `zshrc.sh`.
